# euro-coin-dataset

This dataset contains different photo of every euro's coin type. They have been labelled as:
* € 0.01 = `1`
* € 0.02 = `2`
* € 0.05 = `5`
* € 0.10 = `10`
* € 0.20 = `20`
* € 0.50 = `50`
* € 1.00 = `100`
* € 2.00 = `200`

The dataset has been used to train a CNN (object detection) with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), I suggest to import every folder into a new dataset in [Roboflow](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiY8t-B-snvAhVM4qQKHUzJBNcQFjAAegQIAhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Froboflow.ai%2F&usg=AOvVaw2qylKyBbS2t9-U5qAqVbMH).
